    "RESEARCH_WORKFLOW_INSTRUCTIONS = \"\"\"# Research Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this workflow for all research requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Pre-Flight**: Identify ambiguity in the user's prompt and anticipate where information gaps might exist. Generate 3-5 distinct questions and send them individually to the ask_user tool(). Do not ask generic questions. Ask questions that will drastically narrow the search scope (e.g., \"Do you prioritize speed of implementation or cost-efficiency?\" or \"Should I limit sources to post-2023?\"). Explain *why* you are asking each question.\n",
    "1. **Plan**: Break down the research into focused tasks and save them using the write_todos() tool\n",
    "2. **Save the request**: Use the write_file() tool to save the user's research question to `/research_request.md`\n",
    "3. **Research**: Delegate research tasks to sub-agents using the task() tool - ALWAYS use sub-agents for research, never conduct research yourself\n",
    "4. **Synthesize**: Review all sub-agent findings and consolidate citations (each unique URL gets one number across all findings)\n",
    "5. **Write Report**: Write a comprehensive final report to `/final_report.md` (see Report Writing Guidelines below)\n",
    "6. **Verify**: Read `/research_request.md` and confirm you've addressed all aspects with proper citations and structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Planning Guidelines\n",
    "- Batch similar research tasks into a single TODO to minimize overhead\n",
    "- For simple fact-finding questions, use 1 sub-agent\n",
    "- For comparisons or multi-faceted topics, delegate to multiple parallel sub-agents\n",
    "- Each sub-agent should research one specific aspect and return findings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Report Writing Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing the final report to `/final_report.md`, follow these structure patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For comparisons:**\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "2. Overview of topic A\n",
    "3. Overview of topic B\n",
    "4. Detailed comparison\n",
    "5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**For lists/rankings:**\n",
    "Simply list items with details - no introduction needed:\n",
    "1. Item 1 with explanation\n",
    "2. Item 2 with explanation\n",
    "3. Item 3 with explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**For summaries/overviews:**\n",
    "1. Overview of topic\n",
    "2. Key concept 1\n",
    "3. Key concept 2\n",
    "4. Key concept 3\n",
    "5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**General guidelines:**\n",
    "- Use clear section headings (## for sections, ### for subsections)\n",
    "- Write in paragraph form by default - be text-heavy, not just bullet points\n",
    "- Do NOT use self-referential language (\"I found...\", \"I researched...\")\n",
    "- Write as a professional report without meta-commentary\n",
    "- Each section should be comprehensive and detailed\n",
    "- Use bullet points only when listing is more appropriate than prose\n",
    "\n",
    "**Citation format:**\n",
    "- Cite sources inline using [1], [2], [3] format\n",
    "- Assign each unique URL a single citation number across ALL sub-agent findings\n",
    "- End report with ### Sources section listing each numbered source\n",
    "- Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...)\n",
    "- Format: [1] Source Title: URL (each on separate line for proper list rendering)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the user need?\n",
    "2. **Start with broader searches** - Use broad, comprehensive queries first\n",
    "3. **After each search, pause and assess** - Do I have enough to answer? What's still missing?\n",
    "4. **Execute narrower searches as you gather information** - Fill in the gaps\n",

    "<Final Response Format>\n",
    "When providing your findings back to the orchestrator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure your response**: Organize findings with clear headings and detailed explanations\n",

    "Your role is to coordinate research by delegating tasks from your TODO list to specialized research sub-agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Delegation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**DEFAULT: Start with 1 sub-agent** for most queries:\n",
    "- \"What is quantum computing?\" → 1 sub-agent (general overview)\n",
    "- \"List the top 10 coffee shops in San Francisco\" → 1 sub-agent\n",
    "- \"Summarize the history of the internet\" → 1 sub-agent\n",
    "- \"Research context engineering for AI agents\" → 1 sub-agent (covers all aspects)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ONLY parallelize when the query EXPLICITLY requires comparison or has clearly independent aspects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explicit comparisons** → 1 sub-agent per element:\n",
    "- \"Compare OpenAI vs Anthropic vs DeepMind AI safety approaches\" → 3 parallel sub-agents\n",
    "- \"Compare Python vs JavaScript for web development\" → 2 parallel sub-agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clearly separated aspects** → 1 sub-agent per aspect (use sparingly):\n",
    "- \"Research renewable energy adoption in Europe, Asia, and North America\" → 3 parallel sub-agents (geographic separation)\n",
    "- Only use this pattern when aspects cannot be covered efficiently by a single comprehensive search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Principles\n",
    "- **Bias towards single sub-agent**: One comprehensive research task is more token-efficient than multiple narrow ones\n",
    "- **Avoid premature decomposition**: Don't break \"research X\" into \"research X overview\", \"research X techniques\", \"research X applications\" - just use 1 sub-agent for all of X\n",
    "- **Parallelize only for clear comparisons**: Use multiple sub-agents when comparing distinct entities or geographically separated data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parallel Execution Limits\n",
    "- Use at most {max_concurrent_research_units} parallel sub-agents per iteration\n",
    "- Make multiple task() calls in a single response to enable parallel execution\n",
    "- Each sub-agent returns findings independently\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Limits\n",
    "- Stop after {max_researcher_iterations} delegation rounds if you haven't found adequate sources\n",
    "- Stop when you have sufficient information to answer comprehensively\n",
    "- Bias towards focused research over exhaustive exploration\"\"\""

       "  ToolMessage(content='## General Bare-Root Apple Tree Planting Instructions\\n\\nPlanting bare-root apple trees is an effective way to establish an orchard or add fruit trees to a garden. These trees, shipped without soil around their roots, are cost-effective and allow for inspection of the root system. The best time to plant is in late winter or early spring while the tree is dormant [1].\\n\\n### Site Selection\\nApple trees thrive in sunny locations that receive 6-8 hours of sunlight daily [1, 3]. Ensure the chosen site has well-drained soil, as trees will not survive in consistently soggy conditions. Avoid low-lying areas where water might stand [1, 2]. Also, consider the mature height and width of the apple tree variety to ensure ample space for growth [1].\\n\\n### Hole Preparation\\nWhen preparing the planting hole, dig it two to three times as wide as the root system and deep enough to accommodate the roots without bending them [1, 3]. Some sources suggest making the hole about 1 inch deeper than the roots [3]. Loosen the soil at the bottom of the hole to encourage downward root growth [1]. It is generally recommended not to amend the soil with compost or nutrients extensively, as this can discourage roots from growing beyond the amended area into the native soil, potentially weakening the tree. If compost is used, it should be thoroughly mixed with the existing dirt rather than creating a pocket of amendments [3].\\n\\n### Planting Depth\\nPosition the tree in the hole so that the graft union, which is the swollen area near the base of the trunk, remains 2-3 inches above the ground [1, 3]. Only plant as deep as the top root on the trunk [3].\\n\\n### Root Care\\nUpon receiving bare-root trees, carefully remove them from their packaging and inspect the roots for any damage, mold, or rot. Plump, firm roots are a sign of a healthy tree [1]. Before planting, rehydrate the roots by soaking them in a bucket of water for 1 to 2 hours, or up to 24 hours [1, 2, 3]. Trim off any diseased, kinked, or broken roots with sharp, sanitized pruning shears [2, 3].\\n\\n### Watering\\nAfter placing the tree and backfilling the hole with soil, water thoroughly. Rather than tamping down the soil, add water gradually as you fill the hole; this helps settle the soil around the roots and removes air pockets without compacting the soil [1]. During the first year, keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Provide a deep soak with a hose about twice a week, especially during the first year, to encourage root establishment [1, 3].\\n\\n### Staking\\nStaking may or may not be necessary. If the bare-root tree is a few years old and stands confidently after planting, staking is generally not recommended as too much support can weaken the tree. However, for younger, smaller saplings that might be vulnerable to wind, staking is advisable. If staking, place the stake in the ground before planting to avoid damaging the roots [3].\\n\\n### Initial Pruning\\nInitial pruning is crucial for shaping the tree and promoting strong growth. Trim the trunk to about knee height, or 18-24 inches from the ground, removing at least one-third of the original trunk height [2]. Prune off any limbs that are lower than 18 inches from the ground [3]. Cut the tips of remaining branches at an angle to encourage outward growth. Remove limbs that form tight angles with the trunk, favoring wider angles, which prevent crowding when the tree begins to fruit. Spreading tools can also be used to widen branch angles manually [3]. If the tree blossoms in its first year, it is recommended to remove these blossoms to allow the tree to focus its energy on establishing a strong root system rather than developing fruit [3].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Planting Bare Root Apple Trees: A Complete Guide — Raintree Nursery: https://raintreenursery.com/blogs/pnw-edible-plant-blog/planting-bare-root-apple-trees?srsltid=AfmBOoqeff3WrzA8BN2YhNpCYnmYIxKq7d8eAc3xbc3SlDzDmoKYJk7-\\n[2] Planting Bare-Root Fruit Trees | UC Master Gardener Program of Sonoma County: https://ucanr.edu/site/uc-master-gardener-program-sonoma-county/planting-bare-root-fruit-trees\\n[3] How to Plant a Bare Root Apple Tree - Food Gardening Network: https://foodgardening.mequoda.com/articles/how-to-plant-a-bare-root-apple-tree/', name='task', id='84383e5b-9ec3-49ac-9b50-0fc542d24051', tool_call_id='20d54175-85eb-47ce-a571-b05acd104f0e'),\n",

       "  ToolMessage(content='## Best Practices for Planting Bare-Root Apple Trees in Clay Soil\\n\\nPlanting bare-root apple trees in clay soil presents unique challenges, primarily due to the soil\\'s poor drainage. However, with proper preparation and techniques, successful establishment is achievable. The key lies in improving drainage, judiciously amending the soil, and avoiding common pitfalls.\\n\\n### Improving Drainage\\n\\nEffective drainage is paramount for apple trees in clay soil, as excessive moisture can lead to root and crown rot [4]. Several strategies can be employed:\\n\\n*   **Planting High / Berms / Mounds:** This is a consistently recommended practice. Instead of planting in a depression, build up the planting area into a mound or berm (elevated bed) [1, 3]. This elevates the root crown above the surrounding grade, preventing water from pooling around the base of the tree and improving surface drainage.\\n*   **Scoring the Hole Sides:** When digging the planting hole, rough up or \"score\" the sides of the hole [1, 3]. This helps prevent a smooth, compacted interface between the amended (or unamended) planting hole and the native clay, encouraging roots to grow into the surrounding soil and preventing the \"bathtub effect\" where water collects in the hole [3].\\n*   **Overall Soil Improvement with Organic Matter:** While amending the planting hole directly is often discouraged (see below), improving the overall soil structure of the larger planting area with decomposed organic matter is highly beneficial for long-term drainage [1, 3].\\n*   **Deep-rooted Cover Crops:** In preparation for planting, consider using deep-rooted cover crops like daikon radish to help break up compacted clay over time [3].\\n\\n### Recommended Soil Amendments\\n\\nThe advice on soil amendments for clay soil, particularly for the planting hole, can be conflicting. The consensus among many experts leans towards caution to avoid creating a \"bathtub effect\" [2, 4].\\n\\n*   **Avoid Amending the Planting Hole Directly:** Many sources strongly advise against amending the soil directly within the planting hole with rich or sandy soil [2, 4]. When a sharply different soil texture is introduced into the planting hole, water can drain very slowly out of the amended area into the surrounding heavy clay, essentially creating a submerged pot or \"bathtub\" where roots can drown [2, 4].\\n*   **Organic Matter for Overall Improvement:** The most effective and recommended amendment for improving clay soil structure and drainage is **decomposed organic matter** (DOM), such as compost, well-rotted manure, or leaf mold [1, 3]. This should ideally be incorporated into a broader area than just the planting hole, or as a topdressing, rather than concentrated in the immediate backfill [1, 3]. Aim for a mix where organic material makes up 20-30% of the clay for good results [2].\\n*   **No Sand or Gypsum:** Avoid adding sand or gypsum to clay soil as amendments within the planting hole, as this can lead to a concrete-like consistency [1].\\n\\n### Potential Issues to Avoid\\n\\nWhen planting bare-root apple trees in clay soil, being aware of potential issues is critical for success:\\n\\n*   **Root and Crown Rot:** This is the most significant risk due to poor drainage in clay soil [4]. Ensuring proper drainage through planting high and avoiding the bathtub effect is essential.\\n*   **\"Bathtub Effect\":** This occurs when a planting hole amended with different soil holds water, leading to root suffocation and rot [2, 4]. To prevent this, avoid amending the immediate backfill heavily, rough up the sides of the planting hole, and consider planting on a mound [2, 3].\\n*   **Planting in Waterlogged Areas:** Do not plant in locations that consistently remain wet or have standing water after rain [4].\\n*   **Burying the Graft Union:** Ensure the graft union (the swollen part where the scion meets the rootstock) is 2-3 inches above the soil line [1]. Burying it can lead to crown rot and encourage the scion to root, negating the benefits of the rootstock.\\n*   **Digging Too Large a Hole:** While it might seem intuitive to dig a very large hole, some sources suggest digging a hole only slightly larger than the root ball and backfilling with native soil to avoid creating a drainage differential [4]. The focus should be on broader soil improvement and drainage rather than just the immediate hole.\\n\\nBy following these best practices, bare-root apple trees have a much better chance of thriving even in challenging clay soil conditions.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Dwarf Apple tree in heavy clay - Garden Stack Exchange: https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/21913/dwarf-apple-tree-in-heavy-clay\\n[2] Amending clay soil for vegetable garden and fruit trees/shrubs - Permies.com: https://permies.com/t/44641/Amending-clay-soil-vegetable-garden\\n[3] Improving Soil (Zone 4 Clay) - General Fruit Growing: https://growingfruit.org/t/improving-soil-zone-4-clay/46648\\n[4] Apple/Pear Trees in Clay, wettish soil, Vermont - Habitat Talk: https://habitat-talk.com/threads/apple-pear-trees-in-clay-wettish-soil-vermont.6510/', name='task', id='8c0aa793-2d0a-4bdf-bf5e-c788792e17b1', tool_call_id='afa8038a-dbba-4deb-8b3e-4518e8e0f641'),\n",

       "  ToolMessage(content='## Planting Bare-Root Apple Trees in Coastal Washington State\\n\\nPlanting bare-root apple trees in coastal Washington state, including the Puget Sound region, requires attention to specific environmental factors, variety selection, and pest/disease management to ensure successful establishment and fruit production.\\n\\n### Recommended Planting Times\\n\\nThe best time to plant bare-root apple trees in coastal Washington is during **late winter or early spring**, while the trees are still dormant [2]. This timing allows the roots to establish before the tree breaks dormancy and begins actively growing.\\n\\n### Planting Considerations\\n\\n*   **Site Selection:** Apple trees thrive in sunny locations with well-drained soil. Avoid low-lying areas where water might stand [5].\\n*   **Soil Preparation:**\\n    *   For bare-root trees, prepare a hole that allows the roots to spread out naturally [1].\\n    *   A recommended soil amendment mixture is 1/3 compost, 1/3 peat moss, and 1/3 native soil [3].\\n    *   If drainage is adequate, create a cone of excavated soil in the center of the planting hole to help spread the roots [6].\\n*   **Planting Procedure:** Soak the bare roots before planting. Place the tree in the hole, ensuring the graft union (the bump on the lower trunk) is above the soil line. Spread the roots evenly and then backfill with prepared soil [1, 5].\\n*   **Watering:** After planting, water deeply, typically twice a week, to help the roots settle and establish [5].\\n\\n### Apple Tree Varieties for the Puget Sound Region\\n\\nThe Puget Sound region generally has sufficient chill hours for most apple varieties, implying that varieties requiring higher chill hours (700-1000+ hours) can be successfully grown [8, 9]. When selecting varieties, consider those with good disease resistance, especially to apple scab, a prevalent issue in the region.\\n\\n**Recommended Varieties (often well-suited for Puget Sound/Western Washington):**\\n*   Boskoop [4]\\n*   Red BlackGold [4]\\n*   WhiteGold [4]\\n*   Lapins [4]\\n*   Vandalay [4]\\n*   Sweetheart [4]\\n*   Tehranivee [4]\\n*   Honeycrisp [4]\\n*   Orange Pippin [4]\\n*   Ashmead\\'s Kernel [4]\\n*   Cortland [4]\\n\\n**Varieties to be cautious with due to scab susceptibility in the Puget Sound climate:**\\n*   Gala [4]\\n*   Golden Delicious [4]\\n*   Red Delicious [4]\\n*   Granny Smith [4]\\n\\n### Common Disease and Pest Pressures in Coastal Washington\\n\\nHomeowners in Washington are legally responsible for controlling horticultural pests and diseases [7]. Starting pest management before planting with non-chemical methods and selecting disease-resistant varieties is recommended [7].\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n*   **Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis):** This is a common and destructive fungal disease west of the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington, including coastal British Columbia [10, 11].\\n    *   **Management:** Apply micronized sulfur (without oil) between bud development stages 6-7 (before full bloom) to prevent apple scab and powdery mildew [12]. Fungicides like Bonide Captan 50 WP can also be used in home gardens in Washington [13].\\n*   **Powdery Mildew:** Also a fungal disease, often managed with similar sprays as apple scab [12].\\n\\n**Pests:**\\n*   **Spider Mites:** These are common and can cause significant damage if left unchecked [14].\\n*   **Codling Moth:** A key insect pest, with larvae causing \"worms in the apple.\" While mentioned for Central Washington, management strategies are relevant for home orchards across the state, including coastal areas [12].\\n*   **Apple Maggot:** This pest also impacts fruit quality [12].\\n    *   **Management for Codling Moth and Apple Maggot:**\\n        *   Remove and discard (do not compost) infested fallen fruit [12].\\n        *   Apply kaolin clay spray (e.g., Surround) at petal fall to coat trees and fruit, making them unrecognizable to pests [12].\\n        *   For a high-labor but effective method, bag individual fruits with nylon footies or maggot barriers after thinning. This is effective against apple maggot and 60-80% effective against codling moth if applied early [12].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Bare Root Essentials | Coastal Country: https://www.coastalcountry.com/resource/blog-posts/coastal-101/bare-root-essentials?srsltid=AfmBOoqFsBagGP1tA4wHMo7TTjnuj5QNB6OUjOQi1t361zLUEou_Gk1O\\n[2] Planting Bare Root Apple Trees: A Complete Guide - Raintree Nursery: https://raintreenursery.com/blogs/pnw-edible-plant-blog/planting-bare-root-apple-trees?srsltid=AfmBOorLOIS24Ug_SElVFu91qlKnxkzrPsje5oswBFQnrQj7mROLuSwq\\n[3] Planting Bare Root Apple Trees - Farmette in Bloom: https://farmetteinbloom.com/planting-bare-root-apple-trees/\\n[4] Recommended Fruit Trees for the Puget Sound: https://nwfruit.org/recommended-fruit-trees/\\n[5] How to Plant a Bare Root Apple Tree - Food Gardening Network: https://foodgardening.mequoda.com/articles/how-to-plant-a-bare-root-apple-tree/\\n[6] Planting Bare-Root Fruit Trees | UC Master Gardener Program of ...: https://ucanr.edu/site/uc-master-gardener-program-sonoma-county/planting-bare-root-fruit-trees\\n[7] Apple Pest Management for Home Gardeners (A2179): https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/files/2023/12/Apple-Pest-Management-for-Home-Gardeners-1.pdf\\n[8] Minimum chill requirement for apple trees - Orange Pippin Trees: https://www.orangepippintrees.com/articles/fruit-tree-advice/fruit-tree-minimum-chill-requirement\\n[9] Chill Hours for Fruit Trees - Maps & Charts - Mehrabyan Nursery: https://www.mehrabyannursery.com/growing-guide/fruit-trees/chill-hours-fruit-trees/\\n[10] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\\n[11] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\\n[12] Disease and Pest Management in the Home Orchard: https://www.cloudmountainfarmcenter.org/education/grow-tips/disease-and-pest-management-in-the-home-orchard/\\n[13] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\\n[14] Webbing on apple trees in Washington state can be caused by ...: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Insect.Identification/posts/1745874258861212/', name='task', id='b7034a58-6160-419a-a94a-e27e965e6435', tool_call_id='3426d8f2-56c8-4b66-80ea-5d89eb897b0e'),\n",

This guide provides comprehensive instructions tailored for coastal Washington, incorporating best practices for bare-root trees and clay soil conditions.\\\\n\\\\n## 1. Site Selection and Preparation\\\\n\\\\nSelecting the right site is crucial for the long-term health and productivity of your apple tree.\\\\n\\\\n### Sunlight and Drainage\\\\nApple trees need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily [1, 5]. Choose a location that receives ample sun throughout the day. Well-drained soil is essential, as apple trees will not tolerate consistently soggy conditions, which can lead to root and crown rot [1, 4, 10]. Avoid low-lying areas where water tends to collect [1, 5].\\\\n\\\\n### Addressing Clay Soil Challenges\\\\nCoastal Washington often features clay soil, which can impede drainage. To counteract this, it is highly recommended to improve drainage before planting:\\\\n*   **Planting High / Berms / Mounds:** This is a consistently recommended practice for clay soil. Build up the planting area into an elevated mound or berm to raise the root crown above the surrounding grade. This prevents water from pooling around the base of the tree and improves surface drainage [7, 9].\\\\n*   **Overall Soil Improvement:** Incorporating decomposed organic matter (DOM), such as compost, well-rotted manure, or leaf mold, into a broader area around the planting site will improve the overall soil structure and long-term drainage [7, 9]. Aim for organic material to make up 20-30% of the clay for good results [8].\\\\n*   **Avoid Amending the Planting Hole Directly:** Do not amend the immediate planting hole with significantly different soil, such as rich compost or sand. This can create a \\\\\"bathtub effect\\\\\" where water drains slowly from the amended area into the surrounding heavy clay, leading to root suffocation [8, 10].\\\\n*   **Scoring the Hole Sides:** When digging the planting hole, rough up or \\\\\"score\\\\\" the sides of the hole to prevent a smooth, compacted interface. This encourages roots to grow into the native soil and prevents water from collecting in the hole [7, 9].\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Choosing the Right Apple Variety for Coastal Washington\\\\n\\\\nThe Puget Sound region provides sufficient chill hours for most apple varieties, but selecting disease-resistant types is important due to the prevalence of apple scab [4, 11, 12].\\\\n\\\\n### Recommended Varieties\\\\n*   Boskoop [4]\\\\n*   Red BlackGold [4]\\\\n*   WhiteGold [4]\\\\n*   Lapins [4]\\\\n*   Vandalay [4]\\\\n*   Sweetheart [4]\\\\n*   Tehranivee [4]\\\\n*   Honeycrisp [4]\\\\n*   Orange Pippin [4]\\\\n*   Ashmead\\'s Kernel [4]\\\\n*   Cortland [4]\\\\n\\\\n### Varieties to Approach with Caution (due to scab susceptibility)\\\\n*   Gala [4]\\\\n*   Golden Delicious [4]\\\\n*   Red Delicious [4]\\\\n*   Granny Smith [4]\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Preparing and Planting the Bare-Root Tree\\\\n\\\\n### Optimal Planting Time\\\\nThe best time to plant bare-root apple trees in coastal Washington is in **late winter or early spring** while the tree is dormant [1, 2].\\\\n\\\\n### Root Care and Hole Preparation\\\\n1.  **Inspect and Rehydrate Roots:** Upon receiving your bare-root tree, remove packaging and inspect roots for damage, mold, or rot. Plump, firm roots indicate a healthy tree [1]. Soak the roots in a bucket of water for 1-2 hours, or up to 24 hours, before planting [1, 2, 5].\\\\n2.  **Trim Roots:** Trim off any diseased, kinked, or broken roots with sharp, sanitized pruning shears [2, 5].\\\\n3.  **Dig the Hole:** Dig a hole two to three times as wide as the root system and deep enough to accommodate the roots without bending them [1, 3, 5]. For clay soil, remember to rough up or score the sides of the hole [7, 9]. Loosen the soil at the bottom of the hole to encourage downward root growth [1].\\\\n\\\\n### Planting the Tree\\\\n1.  **Position the Tree:** Create a small cone of soil in the center of the planting hole. Spread the roots evenly over this cone [6].\\\\n2.  **Graft Union Placement:** Position the tree so that the graft union (the swollen area where the scion meets the rootstock) remains 2-3 inches *above* the ground level [1, 3, 5, 10]. Burying the graft union can lead to crown rot and cause the scion to root, negating the benefits of the rootstock.\\\\n3.  **Backfill the Hole:** Gradually backfill the hole with the excavated soil (which ideally has been mixed with organic matter for overall soil improvement, not just in the hole). Water thoroughly as you fill to settle the soil around the roots and eliminate air pockets without compacting the soil [1, 5].\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Post-Planting Care\\\\n\\\\n### Watering\\\\nKeep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during the first year. Provide a deep soak with a hose about twice a week to encourage root establishment [1, 3, 5].\\\\n\\\\n### Staking\\\\nStaking may not be necessary for older, more established bare-root trees that stand confidently. However, younger, smaller saplings vulnerable to wind may benefit from staking. If staking, insert the stake into the ground before planting to avoid damaging the roots [3, 5].\\\\n\\\\n### Initial Pruning\\\\nInitial pruning helps shape the tree and promotes strong growth [2].\\\\n*   Trim the central leader (trunk) to about knee height, or 18-24 inches from the ground, removing at least one-third of the original height [2, 5].\\\\n*   Remove any limbs that are lower than 18 inches from the ground [3, 5].\\\\n*   Cut the tips of remaining branches at an angle to encourage outward growth. Remove limbs that form tight angles with the trunk, favoring wider angles to prevent crowding as the tree fruits. Spreading tools can be used to manually widen branch angles [3, 5].\\\\n*   If the tree produces blossoms in its first year, remove them to allow the tree to focus its energy on root establishment [3, 5].\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Pest and Disease Management in Coastal Washington\\\\n\\\\nHomeowners are responsible for controlling horticultural pests and diseases [11]. Proactive, non-chemical methods and selecting disease-resistant varieties are recommended.\\\\n\\\\n### Diseases\\\\n*   **Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis):** This is a common and destructive fungal disease in Western Washington [12, 13].\\\\n    *   **Management:** Apply micronized sulfur (without oil) between bud development stages 6-7 (before full bloom) to prevent apple scab and powdery mildew [14]. Fungicides like Bonide Captan 50 WP can also be used [15].\\\\n*   **Powdery Mildew:** Also a common fungal disease, often managed with similar sprays as apple scab [14].\\\\n\\\\n### Pests\\\\n*   **Spider Mites:** Can cause significant damage [16].\\\\n*   **Codling Moth & Apple Maggot:** These are key insect pests causing \\\\\"worms in the apple\\\\\" [14].\\\\n    *   **Management:**\\\\n        *   Remove and discard (do not compost) infested fallen fruit [14].\\\\n        *   Apply kaolin clay spray (e.g., Surround) at petal fall to coat trees and fruit, making them unrecognizable to pests [14].\\\\n        *   For a high-labor but effective method, bag individual fruits with nylon footies or maggot barriers after thinning. This is effective against apple maggot and 60-80% effective against codling moth if applied early [14].\\\\n\\\\n### Sources\\\\n[1] Planting Bare Root Apple Trees: A Complete Guide \\\\u2014 Raintree Nursery: https://raintreenursery.com/blogs/pnw-edible-plant-blog/planting-bare-root-apple-trees?srsltid=AfmBOoqeff3WrzA8BN2YhNpCYnmYIxKq7d8eAc3xbc3SlDzDmoKYJk7-\\\\n[2] Bare Root Essentials | Coastal Country: https://www.coastalcountry.com/resource/blog-posts/coastal-101/bare-root-essentials?srsltid=AfmBOoqFsBagGP1tA4wHMo7TTjnuj5QNB6OUjOQi1t361zLUEou_Gk1O\\\\n[3] How to Plant a Bare Root Apple Tree - Food Gardening Network: https://foodgardening.mequoda.com/articles/how-to-plant-a-bare-root-apple-tree/\\\\n[4] Recommended Fruit Trees for the Puget Sound: https://nwfruit.org/recommended-fruit-trees/\\\\n[5] Planting Bare-Root Fruit Trees | UC Master Gardener Program of Sonoma County: https://ucanr.edu/site/uc-master-gardener-program-sonoma-county/planting-bare-root-fruit-trees\\\\n[6] Planting Bare Root Apple Trees - Farmette in Bloom: https://farmetteinbloom.com/planting-bare-root-apple-trees/\\\\n[7] Dwarf Apple tree in heavy clay - Garden Stack Exchange: https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/21913/dwarf-apple-tree-in-heavy-clay\\\\n[8] Amending clay soil for vegetable garden and fruit trees/shrubs - Permies.com: https://permies.com/t/44641/Amending-clay-soil-vegetable-garden\\\\n[9] Improving Soil (Zone 4 Clay) - General Fruit Growing: https://growingfruit.org/t/improving-soil-zone-4-clay/46648\\\\n[10] Apple/Pear Trees in Clay, wettish soil, Vermont - Habitat Talk: https://habitat-talk.com/threads/apple-pear-trees-in-clay-wettish-soil-vermont.6510/\\\\n[11] Apple Pest Management for Home Gardeners (A2179): https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/files/2023/12/Apple-Pest-Management-for-Home-Gardeners-1.pdf\\\\n[12] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\\\\n[13] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\\\\n[14] Disease and Pest Management in the Home Orchard: https://www.cloudmountainfarmcenter.org/education/grow-tips/disease-and-pest-management-in-the-home-orchard/\\\\n[15] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\\\\n[16] Webbing on apple trees in Washington state can be caused by ...: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Insect.Identification/posts/1745874258861212/\\\\n\"}'}, '__gemini_function_call_thought_signatures__': {'52f2dcf5-43d5-4bf3-81da-03968c0cf46f': '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'}}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b05cd-009c-7512-a330-2790ab848ebc-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'write_file', 'args': {'file_path': '/final_report.md', 'content': '# How to Best Plant a Bare-Root Apple Tree in Coastal Washington\\'s Clay Soil\\n\\nPlanting a bare-root apple tree requires careful attention to site preparation, planting technique, and initial care, especially when dealing with specific regional climates and challenging soil types like clay.

This prevents water from pooling around the base of the tree and improves surface drainage [7, 9].\\n*   **Overall Soil Improvement:** Incorporating decomposed organic matter (DOM), such as compost, well-rotted manure, or leaf mold, into a broader area around the planting site will improve the overall soil structure and long-term drainage [7, 9]. Aim for organic material to make up 20-30% of the clay for good results [8].\\n*   **Avoid Amending the Planting Hole Directly:** Do not amend the immediate planting hole with significantly different soil, such as rich compost or sand. This can create a \"bathtub effect\" where water drains slowly from the amended area into the surrounding heavy clay, leading to root suffocation [8, 10].\\n*   **Scoring the Hole Sides:** When digging the planting hole, rough up or \"score\" the sides of the hole to prevent a smooth, compacted interface. This encourages roots to grow into the native soil and prevents water from collecting in the hole [7, 9].\\n\\n## 2. Choosing the Right Apple Variety for Coastal Washington\\n\\nThe Puget Sound region provides sufficient chill hours for most apple varieties, but selecting disease-resistant types is important due to the prevalence of apple scab [4, 11, 12].\\n\\n### Recommended Varieties\\n*   Boskoop [4]\\n*   Red BlackGold [4]\\n*   WhiteGold [4]\\n*   Lapins [4]\\n*   Vandalay [4]\\n*   Sweetheart [4]\\n*   Tehranivee [4]\\n*   Honeycrisp [4]\\n*   Orange Pippin [4]\\n*   Ashmead\\'s Kernel [4]\\n*   Cortland [4]\\n\\n### Varieties to Approach with Caution (due to scab susceptibility)\\n*   Gala [4]\\n*   Golden Delicious [4]\\n*   Red Delicious [4]\\n*   Granny Smith [4]\\n\\n## 3. Preparing and Planting the Bare-Root Tree\\n\\n### Optimal Planting Time\\nThe best time to plant bare-root apple trees in coastal Washington is in **late winter or early spring** while the tree is dormant [1, 2].\\n\\n### Root Care and Hole Preparation\\n1.  **Inspect and Rehydrate Roots:** Upon receiving your bare-root tree, remove packaging and inspect roots for damage, mold, or rot. Plump, firm roots indicate a healthy tree [1]. Soak the roots in a bucket of water for 1-2 hours, or up to 24 hours, before planting [1, 2, 5].\\n2.  **Trim Roots:** Trim off any diseased, kinked, or broken roots with sharp, sanitized pruning shears [2, 5].\\n3.  **Dig the Hole:** Dig a hole two to three times as wide as the root system and deep enough to accommodate the roots without bending them [1, 3, 5]. For clay soil, remember to rough up or score the sides of the hole [7, 9]. Loosen the soil at the bottom of the hole to encourage downward root growth [1].\\n\\n### Planting the Tree\\n1.  **Position the Tree:** Create a small cone of soil in the center of the planting hole. Spread the roots evenly over this cone [6].\\n2.  **Graft Union Placement:** Position the tree so that the graft union (the swollen area where the scion meets the rootstock) remains 2-3 inches *above* the ground level [1, 3, 5, 10]. Burying the graft union can lead to crown rot and cause the scion to root, negating the benefits of the rootstock.\\n3.  **Backfill the Hole:** Gradually backfill the hole with the excavated soil (which ideally has been mixed with organic matter for overall soil improvement, not just in the hole). Water thoroughly as you fill to settle the soil around the roots and eliminate air pockets without compacting the soil [1, 5].\\n\\n## 4. Post-Planting Care\\n\\n### Watering\\nKeep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during the first year. Provide a deep soak with a hose about twice a week to encourage root establishment [1, 3, 5].\\n\\n### Staking\\nStaking may not be necessary for older, more established bare-root trees that stand confidently. However, younger, smaller saplings vulnerable to wind may benefit from staking. If staking, insert the stake into the ground before planting to avoid damaging the roots [3, 5].\\n\\n### Initial Pruning\\nInitial pruning helps shape the tree and promotes strong growth [2].\\n*   Trim the central leader (trunk) to about knee height, or 18-24 inches from the ground, removing at least one-third of the original height [2, 5].\\n*   Remove any limbs that are lower than 18 inches from the ground [3, 5].\\n*   Cut the tips of remaining branches at an angle to encourage outward growth. Remove limbs that form tight angles with the trunk, favoring wider angles to prevent crowding as the tree fruits. Spreading tools can be used to manually widen branch angles [3, 5].\\n*   If the tree produces blossoms in its first year, remove them to allow the tree to focus its energy on root establishment [3, 5].\\n\\n## 5. Pest and Disease Management in Coastal Washington\\n\\nHomeowners are responsible for controlling horticultural pests and diseases [11]. Proactive, non-chemical methods and selecting disease-resistant varieties are recommended.\\n\\n### Diseases\\n*   **Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis):** This is a common and destructive fungal disease in Western Washington [12, 13].\\n    *   **Management:** Apply micronized sulfur (without oil) between bud development stages 6-7 (before full bloom) to prevent apple scab and powdery mildew [14]. Fungicides like Bonide Captan 50 WP can also be used [15].\\n*   **Powdery Mildew:** Also a common fungal disease, often managed with similar sprays as apple scab [14].\\n\\n### Pests\\n*   **Spider Mites:** Can cause significant damage [16].\\n*   **Codling Moth & Apple Maggot:** These are key insect pests causing \"worms in the apple\" [14].\\n    *   **Management:**\\n        *   Remove and discard (do not compost) infested fallen fruit [14].\\n        *   Apply kaolin clay spray (e.g., Surround) at petal fall to coat trees and fruit, making them unrecognizable to pests [14].\\n        *   For a high-labor but effective method, bag individual fruits with nylon footies or maggot barriers after thinning. This is effective against apple maggot and 60-80% effective against codling moth if applied early [14].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Planting Bare Root Apple Trees: A Complete Guide — Raintree Nursery: https://raintreenursery.com/blogs/pnw-edible-plant-blog/planting-bare-root-apple-trees?srsltid=AfmBOoqeff3WrzA8BN2YhNpCYnmYIxKq7d8eAc3xbc3SlDzDmoKYJk7-\\n[2] Bare Root Essentials | Coastal Country: https://www.coastalcountry.com/resource/blog-posts/coastal-101/bare-root-essentials?srsltid=AfmBOoqFsBagGP1tA4wHMo7TTjnuj5QNB6OUjOQi1t361zLUEou_Gk1O\\n[3] How to Plant a Bare Root Apple Tree - Food Gardening Network: https://foodgardening.mequoda.com/articles/how-to-plant-a-bare-root-apple-tree/\\n[4] Recommended Fruit Trees for the Puget Sound: https://nwfruit.org/recommended-fruit-trees/\\n[5] Planting Bare-Root Fruit Trees | UC Master Gardener Program of Sonoma County: https://ucanr.edu/site/uc-master-gardener-program-sonoma-county/planting-bare-root-fruit-trees\\n[6] Planting Bare Root Apple Trees - Farmette in Bloom: https://farmetteinbloom.com/planting-bare-root-apple-trees/\\n[7] Dwarf Apple tree in heavy clay - Garden Stack Exchange: https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/21913/dwarf-apple-tree-in-heavy-clay\\n[8] Amending clay soil for vegetable garden and fruit trees/shrubs - Permies.com: https://permies.com/t/44641/Amending-clay-soil-vegetable-garden\\n[9] Improving Soil (Zone 4 Clay) - General Fruit Growing: https://growingfruit.org/t/improving-soil-zone-4-clay/46648\\n[10] Apple/Pear Trees in Clay, wettish soil, Vermont - Habitat Talk: https://habitat-talk.com/threads/apple-pear-trees-in-clay-wettish-soil-vermont.6510/\\n[11] Apple Pest Management for Home Gardeners (A2179): https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/files/2023/12/Apple-Pest-Management-for-Home-Gardeners-1.pdf\\n[12] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\\n[13] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\\n[14] Disease and Pest Management in the Home Orchard: https://www.cloudmountainfarmcenter.org/education/grow-tips/disease-and-pest-management-in-the-home-orchard/\\n[15] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\\n[16] Webbing on apple trees in Washington state can be caused by ...: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Insect.Identification/posts/1745874258861212/\\n'}, 'id': '52f2dcf5-43d5-4bf3-81da-03968c0cf46f', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12707, 'output_tokens': 2776, 'total_tokens': 15483, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 11909}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 81}}),\n",

Choose a location that receives ample sun throughout the day. Well-drained soil is essential, as apple trees will not tolerate consistently soggy conditions, which can lead to root and crown rot [1, 4, 10]. Avoid low-lying areas where water tends to collect [1, 5].\\n    11\\t\\n    12\\t### Addressing Clay Soil Challenges\\n    13\\tCoastal Washington often features clay soil, which can impede drainage.

       "    '',\n",
       "    '### Sunlight and Drainage',\n",
       "    'Apple trees need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily [1, 5]. Choose a location that receives ample sun throughout the day. Well-drained soil is essential, as apple trees will not tolerate consistently soggy conditions, which can lead to root and crown rot [1, 4, 10]. Avoid low-lying areas where water tends to collect [1, 5].',\n",

       "    '### Addressing Clay Soil Challenges',\n",
       "    'Coastal Washington often features clay soil, which can impede drainage. To counteract this, it is highly recommended to improve drainage before planting:',\n",
       "    '*   **Planting High / Berms / Mounds:** This is a consistently recommended practice for clay soil. Build up the planting area into an elevated mound or berm to raise the root crown above the surrounding grade. This prevents water from pooling around the base of the tree and improves surface drainage [7, 9].',\n",
       "    '*   **Overall Soil Improvement:** Incorporating decomposed organic matter (DOM), such as compost, well-rotted manure, or leaf mold, into a broader area around the planting site will improve the overall soil structure and long-term drainage [7, 9]. Aim for organic material to make up 20-30% of the clay for good results [8].',\n",
       "    '*   **Avoid Amending the Planting Hole Directly:** Do not amend the immediate planting hole with significantly different soil, such as rich compost or sand. This can create a \"bathtub effect\" where water drains slowly from the amended area into the surrounding heavy clay, leading to root suffocation [8, 10].',\n",
       "    '*   **Scoring the Hole Sides:** When digging the planting hole, rough up or \"score\" the sides of the hole to prevent a smooth, compacted interface. This encourages roots to grow into the native soil and prevents water from collecting in the hole [7, 9].',\n",

       "    '',\n",
       "    '### Root Care and Hole Preparation',\n",
       "    '1.  **Inspect and Rehydrate Roots:** Upon receiving your bare-root tree, remove packaging and inspect roots for damage, mold, or rot. Plump, firm roots indicate a healthy tree [1]. Soak the roots in a bucket of water for 1-2 hours, or up to 24 hours, before planting [1, 2, 5].',\n",
       "    '2.  **Trim Roots:** Trim off any diseased, kinked, or broken roots with sharp, sanitized pruning shears [2, 5].',\n",
       "    '3.  **Dig the Hole:** Dig a hole two to three times as wide as the root system and deep enough to accommodate the roots without bending them [1, 3, 5]. For clay soil, remember to rough up or score the sides of the hole [7, 9]. Loosen the soil at the bottom of the hole to encourage downward root growth [1].',\n",
       "    '',\n",
       "    '### Planting the Tree',\n",
       "    '1.  **Position the Tree:** Create a small cone of soil in the center of the planting hole. Spread the roots evenly over this cone [6].',\n",
       "    '2.  **Graft Union Placement:** Position the tree so that the graft union (the swollen area where the scion meets the rootstock) remains 2-3 inches *above* the ground level [1, 3, 5, 10]. Burying the graft union can lead to crown rot and cause the scion to root, negating the benefits of the rootstock.',\n",
       "    '3.  **Backfill the Hole:** Gradually backfill the hole with the excavated soil (which ideally has been mixed with organic matter for overall soil improvement, not just in the hole). Water thoroughly as you fill to settle the soil around the roots and eliminate air pockets without compacting the soil [1, 5].',\n",

       "    '*   Cut the tips of remaining branches at an angle to encourage outward growth. Remove limbs that form tight angles with the trunk, favoring wider angles to prevent crowding as the tree fruits. Spreading tools can be used to manually widen branch angles [3, 5].',\n",

This guide provides comprehensive instructions tailored for coastal Washington, incorporating best practices for bare-root trees and clay soil conditions.\n\n## 1. Site Selection and Preparation\n\nSelecting the right site is crucial for the long-term health and productivity of your apple tree.\n\n### Sunlight and Drainage\nApple trees need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily [1, 5]. Choose a location that receives ample sun throughout the day. Well-drained soil is essential, as apple trees will not tolerate consistently soggy conditions, which can lead to root and crown rot [1, 4, 10]. Avoid low-lying areas where water tends to collect [1, 5].\n\n### Addressing Clay Soil Challenges\nCoastal Washington often features clay soil, which can impede drainage. To counteract this, it is highly recommended to improve drainage before planting:\n*   **Planting High / Berms / Mounds:** This is a consistently recommended practice for clay soil. Build up the planting area into an elevated mound or berm to raise the root crown above the surrounding grade. This prevents water from pooling around the base of the tree and improves surface drainage [7, 9].\n*   **Overall Soil Improvement:** Incorporating decomposed organic matter (DOM), such as compost, well-rotted manure, or leaf mold, into a broader area around the planting site will improve the overall soil structure and long-term drainage [7, 9]. Aim for organic material to make up 20-30% of the clay for good results [8].\n*   **Avoid Amending the Planting Hole Directly:** Do not amend the immediate planting hole with significantly different soil, such as rich compost or sand. This can create a \"bathtub effect\" where water drains slowly from the amended area into the surrounding heavy clay, leading to root suffocation [8, 10].\n*   **Scoring the Hole Sides:** When digging the planting hole, rough up or \"score\" the sides of the hole to prevent a smooth, compacted interface. This encourages roots to grow into the native soil and prevents water from collecting in the hole [7, 9].\n\n## 2. Choosing the Right Apple Variety for Coastal Washington\n\nThe Puget Sound region provides sufficient chill hours for most apple varieties, but selecting disease-resistant types is important due to the prevalence of apple scab [4, 11, 12].\n\n### Recommended Varieties\n*   Boskoop [4]\n*   Red BlackGold [4]\n*   WhiteGold [4]\n*   Lapins [4]\n*   Vandalay [4]\n*   Sweetheart [4]\n*   Tehranivee [4]\n*   Honeycrisp [4]\n*   Orange Pippin [4]\n*   Ashmead's Kernel [4]\n*   Cortland [4]\n\n### Varieties to Approach with Caution (due to scab susceptibility)\n*   Gala [4]\n*   Golden Delicious [4]\n*   Red Delicious [4]\n*   Granny Smith [4]\n\n## 3. Preparing and Planting the Bare-Root Tree\n\n### Optimal Planting Time\nThe best time to plant bare-root apple trees in coastal Washington is in **late winter or early spring** while the tree is dormant [1, 2].\n\n### Root Care and Hole Preparation\n1.  **Inspect and Rehydrate Roots:** Upon receiving your bare-root tree, remove packaging and inspect roots for damage, mold, or rot. Plump, firm roots indicate a healthy tree [1]. Soak the roots in a bucket of water for 1-2 hours, or up to 24 hours, before planting [1, 2, 5].\n2.  **Trim Roots:** Trim off any diseased, kinked, or broken roots with sharp, sanitized pruning shears [2, 5].\n3.  **Dig the Hole:** Dig a hole two to three times as wide as the root system and deep enough to accommodate the roots without bending them [1, 3, 5]. For clay soil, remember to rough up or score the sides of the hole [7, 9]. Loosen the soil at the bottom of the hole to encourage downward root growth [1].\n\n### Planting the Tree\n1.  **Position the Tree:** Create a small cone of soil in the center of the planting hole. Spread the roots evenly over this cone [6].\n2.  **Graft Union Placement:** Position the tree so that the graft union (the swollen area where the scion meets the rootstock) remains 2-3 inches *above* the ground level [1, 3, 5, 10]. Burying the graft union can lead to crown rot and cause the scion to root, negating the benefits of the rootstock.\n3.  **Backfill the Hole:** Gradually backfill the hole with the excavated soil (which ideally has been mixed with organic matter for overall soil improvement, not just in the hole). Water thoroughly as you fill to settle the soil around the roots and eliminate air pockets without compacting the soil [1, 5].\n\n## 4. Post-Planting Care\n\n### Watering\nKeep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during the first year. Provide a deep soak with a hose about twice a week to encourage root establishment [1, 3, 5].\n\n### Staking\nStaking may not be necessary for older, more established bare-root trees that stand confidently. However, younger, smaller saplings vulnerable to wind may benefit from staking. If staking, insert the stake into the ground before planting to avoid damaging the roots [3, 5].\n\n### Initial Pruning\nInitial pruning helps shape the tree and promotes strong growth [2].\n*   Trim the central leader (trunk) to about knee height, or 18-24 inches from the ground, removing at least one-third of the original height [2, 5].\n*   Remove any limbs that are lower than 18 inches from the ground [3, 5].\n*   Cut the tips of remaining branches at an angle to encourage outward growth. Remove limbs that form tight angles with the trunk, favoring wider angles to prevent crowding as the tree fruits. Spreading tools can be used to manually widen branch angles [3, 5].\n*   If the tree produces blossoms in its first year, remove them to allow the tree to focus its energy on root establishment [3, 5].\n\n## 5. Pest and Disease Management in Coastal Washington\n\nHomeowners are responsible for controlling horticultural pests and diseases [11]. Proactive, non-chemical methods and selecting disease-resistant varieties are recommended.\n\n### Diseases\n*   **Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis):** This is a common and destructive fungal disease in Western Washington [12, 13].\n    *   **Management:** Apply micronized sulfur (without oil) between bud development stages 6-7 (before full bloom) to prevent apple scab and powdery mildew [14]. Fungicides like Bonide Captan 50 WP can also be used [15].\n*   **Powdery Mildew:** Also a common fungal disease, often managed with similar sprays as apple scab [14].\n\n### Pests\n*   **Spider Mites:** Can cause significant damage [16].\n*   **Codling Moth & Apple Maggot:** These are key insect pests causing \"worms in the apple\" [14].\n    *   **Management:**\n        *   Remove and discard (do not compost) infested fallen fruit [14].\n        *   Apply kaolin clay spray (e.g., Surround) at petal fall to coat trees and fruit, making them unrecognizable to pests [14].\n        *   For a high-labor but effective method, bag individual fruits with nylon footies or maggot barriers after thinning. This is effective against apple maggot and 60-80% effective against codling moth if applied early [14].\n\n### Sources\n[1] Planting Bare Root Apple Trees: A Complete Guide — Raintree Nursery: https://raintreenursery.com/blogs/pnw-edible-plant-blog/planting-bare-root-apple-trees?srsltid=AfmBOoqeff3WrzA8BN2YhNpCYnmYIxKq7d8eAc3xbc3SlDzDmoKYJk7-\n[2] Bare Root Essentials | Coastal Country: https://www.coastalcountry.com/resource/blog-posts/coastal-101/bare-root-essentials?srsltid=AfmBOoqFsBagGP1tA4wHMo7TTjnuj5QNB6OUjOQi1t361zLUEou_Gk1O\n[3] How to Plant a Bare Root Apple Tree - Food Gardening Network: https://foodgardening.mequoda.com/articles/how-to-plant-a-bare-root-apple-tree/\n[4] Recommended Fruit Trees for the Puget Sound: https://nwfruit.org/recommended-fruit-trees/\n[5] Planting Bare-Root Fruit Trees | UC Master Gardener Program of Sonoma County: https://ucanr.edu/site/uc-master-gardener-program-sonoma-county/planting-bare-root-fruit-trees\n[6] Planting Bare Root Apple Trees - Farmette in Bloom: https://farmetteinbloom.com/planting-bare-root-apple-trees/\n[7] Dwarf Apple tree in heavy clay - Garden Stack Exchange: https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/21913/dwarf-apple-tree-in-heavy-clay\n[8] Amending clay soil for vegetable garden and fruit trees/shrubs - Permies.com: https://permies.com/t/44641/Amending-clay-soil-vegetable-garden\n[9] Improving Soil (Zone 4 Clay) - General Fruit Growing: https://growingfruit.org/t/improving-soil-zone-4-clay/46648\n[10] Apple/Pear Trees in Clay, wettish soil, Vermont - Habitat Talk: https://habitat-talk.com/threads/apple-pear-trees-in-clay-wettish-soil-vermont.6510/\n[11] Apple Pest Management for Home Gardeners (A2179): https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/files/2023/12/Apple-Pest-Management-for-Home-Gardeners-1.pdf\n[12] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\n[13] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\n[14] Disease and Pest Management in the Home Orchard: https://www.cloudmountainfarmcenter.org/education/grow-tips/disease-and-pest-management-in-the-home-orchard/\n[15] Apple (Malus spp.)-Scab | Pacific Northwest Pest Management ...: https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/apple-malus-spp-scab\n[16] Webbing on apple trees in Washington state can be caused by ...: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Insect.Identification/posts/1745874258861212/\n"
